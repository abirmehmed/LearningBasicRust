As the Name Said . Trying to Learn and Solve Basic Rust Programming Language .

1. Write a function that takes in a string and returns the first non-repeated character in the string.
2. Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns the sum of all the elements.
3. Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns the product of all the elements.
4. Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns the largest element.
5. Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns the smallest element.
6. Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns the average value of all the elements.
7. Write a function that takes in two strings and checks if one is an anagram of the other.
8. Write a function that takes in two strings and checks if one is a permutation of the other.
9. Write a function that takes in two strings and checks if they are palindromes (the same forwards as backwards).
10.Write a function that takes in two strings and checks if they are rotations of each other (e.g., “abc” is a rotation of “bca”).
11. Write a program to print out all permutations of a given string (e.g., for “abc”, print out “abc”, “acb”, “bac”, “bca”, “cab”, “cba”).
12 .Implement binary search on an ordered list of integers.
13. Implement quicksort on an unordered list of integers.

18. Implement heap sort on an unordered list of integers.
19. Implement radix sort on an unordered list of integers with non-negative values only 
20.Implement counting sort on an unordered list with non-negative integer values only.
21.Write a function that takes in a string and returns the number of vowels in the string.
22. Write a function that takes in a string and returns the number of consonants in the string.
23. Write a function that takes in a string and returns the number of words in the string (words are separated by spaces).
24. Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns an array with all the even numbers first followed by all the odd numbers.
25. Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns an array with all the positive numbers first followed by all the negative numbers.
26. Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns an array with all elements sorted in ascending order using bubble sort.
27. Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns an array with all elements sorted in descending order using bubble sort.
28.Write a program to print out all combinations of k elements from n distinct elements (e.g., for n=3, k=2, print out “ab”, “ac”, “bc”).
29.Implement depth-first search on a graph represented as an adjacency list or adjacency matrix.
30. Implement breadth-first search on a graph represented as an adjacency list or adjacency matrix.
